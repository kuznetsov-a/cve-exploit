# The last 10 years: exploratory analysis of publicly available vulnerabilities and exploits data for the period of 2009-2018


In my day job, I spend a lot of time looking at various vulnerability management/patching reports and trying to assess the risk exposure arising from missing patches. It is clear that some vulnerabilities (and assets) are more important than others and the right prioritization of remediation is paramount.

The goal of this work is to better understand the various factors that determine if a vulnerability will be actually exploited (and can cause real damage to the organization) and to apply my data analysis skills to a real world problem. This includes main software vendors and products, CVSS scores, linked CWEs and other parameters that are part of a standard CVRF entry. Hopefully, these results will be useful to other people in the industry and might spark additional discussions/investigations.

I tried to visualize the most important relationships using the applicable chart types. Findings that I have found interesting are marked with numbered NB tags.

This [notebook](https://github.com/kuznetsov-a/cve-exploit/blob/master/cve_exploit.ipynb) is using public CVE, CVRF and CWE data from NIST NVD and MITRE and should be fully reproducible in Google Colab.

Obviously, this is purely a work of fiction, does not reflect the views of any organizationno responsibility for accuracy is assumed etc etc etc
